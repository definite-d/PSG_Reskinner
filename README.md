## What's Reskinner?
Reskinner is a Python 3 plugin for PySimpleGUI's Tkinter port which enables changing the theme of a PySimpleGUI window on the fly without the need for re-instantiating the window.

## Example Usage (Demo)

```python
# Reskinner Version 2

from psg_reskinner import reskin, animated_reskin, __version__
from PySimpleGUI import Window, Text, Button, DropDown, Push, theme_list, theme, LOOK_AND_FEEL_TABLE, TIMEOUT_KEY
from random import choice as rc

window_layout = [
    [Text('Hello!', font=('Helvetica', 20))],
    [Text('You are currently running Reskinner instead of importing it.')],
    [Text('Clicking the button will change the theme to the one specified.')],
    [Text('Or do nothing. The theme will change every few seconds')],
    [DropDown(values=theme_list(), default_value='DarkBlue3', k='new_theme')],
    [Button('Change Theme', k='change')],
    [Text(f'Reskinner v{__version__}', font=('Helvetica', 8), pad=(0, 0)), Push()],
]

window = Window('Reskinner Demo', window_layout, element_justification='center')

while True:

    e, v = window.Read(timeout=2000)

    if e in (None, 'Exit'):
        window.Close()
        break

    if e == 'change':
        reskin(window, v['new_theme'], theme, LOOK_AND_FEEL_TABLE)

    elif e == TIMEOUT_KEY:
        '''reskin(window, rc(theme_list()), theme, LOOK_AND_FEEL_TABLE)'''
        animated_reskin(window=window,
                        new_theme=rc(theme_list()),
                        theme_function=theme,
                        lf_table=LOOK_AND_FEEL_TABLE)
``` 

## How does it work?

Reskinner runs through each element in a window, then by relying on the `Element.Widget` interface to access the underlying Tkinter object, it applies style changes to the window.

## What's the story behind psg_reskinner?
Like [Unda](https://github.com/definite-d/unda), I created Reskinner to be a part/feature of a desktop application which I'm developing, however, I decided to open-source it, as I imagined other developers would find such functionality useful in their projects as well.

Development began on Monday 15th August 2022.

## Why is it called Reskinner?
I didn't want it to go against the built-in conventions of `theme` and `look_and_feel` that PySimpleGUI has.

## Standards
Reskinner is:

 -[X] built using Python 3.7 (in PyCharm),
